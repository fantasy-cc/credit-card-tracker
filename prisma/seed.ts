      description: 'Maximize your airline fee reimbursements and get the most value from your travel credits',
      category: 'Travel',
      content: `## Getting Reimbursed

Airline fee credits are designed to offset incidental charges when flying. To ensure you get reimbursed:

1. **Purchase eligible items directly from the airline** - Book on the airline's website or app, not through third-party sites
2. **Use the credit card linked to this benefit** - Make sure you're using the correct card for the purchase
3. **Credits post within 1-2 billing cycles** - Be patient, reimbursements aren't instant

## What Qualifies

Most issuers cover these airline fees:
- âï¸ Checked bag fees
- ðº Seat selection and upgrades
- ð½ï¸ In-flight food and beverage purchases
- ð Change and cancellation fees
- ð Phone booking fees
- ð Carry-on bag fees (budget airlines)

## What Doesn't Qualify

Be aware these typically don't count:
- â Actual ticket purchases
- â Bookings through third-party sites (Expedia, Kayak, etc.)
- â Gift cards (some issuers restrict this)
- â Travel packages or vacation bundles

## Pro Tips

- Check your specific issuer's terms for the detailed list
- Some cards require you to select a preferred airline at the start of the year
- Credits usually don't roll over to the next year
- Set calendar reminders before expiration`,
      tips: [
        'Book directly on airline website, not through OTAs like Expedia',
        'Check your issuer\'s specific list of qualifying purchases',
        'Credits typically post within 1-2 statements, not immediately',
        'Some cards require pre-selecting your airline for the year'

      slug: 'rideshare-credits',
      description: 'Redeem your monthly ride-sharing credits and get free transportation',
      category: 'Transportation',
      content: `## Activation Steps

Getting your Uber/Lyft credits is straightforward:

1. **Link your credit card** - Add the card to your Uber or Lyft app payment methods
2. **Credits auto-apply at checkout** - No need to manually activate
3. **Must use within the month** - Credits typically don't roll over month-to-month

## Uber Cash Details

For cards offering Uber Cash:
- ðµ Credits deposit on the 1st of each month (or your card anniversary)
- ð Can be used for Uber Eats food delivery too
- ð Split payment if ride exceeds credit amount
- ð Expires at month-end - use it or lose it

## Lyft Credit Details

For cards offering Lyft credits:
- ð Applied automatically at checkout
- ð³ Must use the enrolled card for the ride
- ð± Credits show in your Lyft wallet
- â° Monthly reset varies by issuer

## Maximizing Value

**For Uber Credits:**
- Use Uber Eats for groceries or restaurant delivery
- Combine multiple trips if your credit is small
- Stack with Uber promotions when available

**For Lyft Credits:**
- Take advantage during surge pricing times
- Use for airport rides to maximize value
- Combine with Lyft Pink membership benefits

## Common Issues

- â ï¸ Credits don't stack month-to-month
- â ï¸ Tips don't count toward credit usage
- â ï¸ Must complete ride/delivery in the same month`,
      tips: [
        'Set a reminder to use credits before month-end',
        'Uber credits work for both rides AND Uber Eats',
        'Credits don\'t roll over - use them or lose them',
        'Link the card before the month starts to ensure credits deposit'

      slug: 'hotel-credits',
      description: 'Book hotels and get automatic statement credits',
      category: 'Travel',
      content: `## Booking Process

To receive your hotel credit:

1. **Book through the qualifying portal** - Requirements vary by card issuer
2. **Use your enrolled credit card** - Pay with the card that offers the benefit
3. **Credit posts after checkout** - Not at booking time, but after your stay completes

## Qualifying Booking Portals

**American Express:**
- Amex Travel portal
- Fine Hotels & Resorts program
- The Hotel Collection

**Chase:**
- Chase Travel Portal (Chase Ultimate Rewards)
- Direct hotel bookings (card-specific)

**Capital One:**
- Capital One Travel portal
- Direct hotel bookings

**Citi:**
- Citi Travel Portal
- Prestige Hotel Collection

## Important Requirements

- ð° Some require minimum annual spend ($500-$1,000)
- â³ Credits may take 8-12 weeks to post
- ð Read your specific issuer's terms carefully
- ð¨ Must complete the stay (not just book)

## Maximizing Your Credit

**Booking Strategy:**
- Book early to ensure credit posts before year-end
- Combine with hotel loyalty programs
- Look for properties that double-dip (credit + points)
- Consider extended stays to meet minimum spend requirements

**Credit Timing:**
- Book at least 3 months before credit expiration
- Account for statement closing dates
- Contact issuer if credit doesn't post within timeframe

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

â Booking through third-party sites (Booking.com, Hotels.com)
â Using points instead of cash payment
â Cancelling before the stay is completed
â Not meeting minimum spend requirements`,
      tips: [
        'Book early to ensure credit posts before expiration',
        'Confirm you\'re using the correct booking platform',
        'Credits post AFTER checkout, not at booking',
        'Track your statement to verify the credit appears',
        'Some credits require minimum annual hotel spend'

        'Some credits require enrollment or activation first',
