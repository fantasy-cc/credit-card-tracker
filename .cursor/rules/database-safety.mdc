# Database Safety Rules
# This rule prevents dangerous database operations that could wipe production data.

when: always
description: "CRITICAL: Never run destructive database commands that could affect production data. Always verify environment and use safe alternatives."

## Forbidden Commands (NEVER RUN):
- `npx prisma migrate reset` - Wipes ALL data including production
- `npx prisma migrate reset --force` - Force wipes ALL data 
- `npx prisma db push --force-reset` - Force resets database schema
- `DROP DATABASE` or similar SQL commands
- Any command with `--force-reset` flag

## Safe Alternatives:
- For local development: Check DATABASE_URL points to local/dev database first
- For schema changes: Use `npx prisma migrate dev` (creates migration files)
- For production: Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` (applies migrations safely)
- For local reset: Verify you're in development environment first

## Before ANY database operation:
1. Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Confirm you're NOT connected to production database
3. Use migration files instead of reset commands
4. Always backup production data before schema changes

## Emergency Protocol:
If production data is accidentally affected:
1. Immediately stop all database operations
2. Check if database backups are available
3. Contact database administrator
4. Document the incident for post-mortem

Remember: Production data is irreplaceable. When in doubt, don't run the command.
