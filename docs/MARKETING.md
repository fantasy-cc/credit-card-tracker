## Reddit Marketing Strategy

### Successful r/CreditCards Campaign (May 2025)

#### Background
- **Target Audience**: Credit card users struggling with benefit tracking
- **Primary Challenge**: Reddit's strict anti-self-promotion filters
- **Solution**: Community-first, filter-safe approach

#### What Worked
**Post Title**: "How do you track credit card annual benefits? I keep missing deadlines"

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **New Account Strategy**: Used fresh account to avoid history bias
2. **Filter-Safe Content**: No direct links, no promotional language
3. **Problem-First Approach**: Focused on shared pain points
4. **Community Engagement**: Asked for advice before offering solution
5. **Organic Link Sharing**: Shared link only when requested in comments

#### Post Performance
- **Subreddit**: r/CreditCards (500K+ members)
- **Status**: Successfully published and engaged
- **Approach**: Filter-safe version without direct links

#### Content Strategy That Worked

**Opening Hook**:
```
I've been getting more serious about maximizing my credit card benefits, 
but I keep missing annual credits and it's starting to add up. This year alone I've lost:
- $200 Amex airline credit (forgot the deadline)
- $100 Chase travel credit (didn't realize it reset)
- Various quarterly bonuses because I forgot to activate
```

**Engagement Questions**:
- How do you all manage this?
- Do you use spreadsheets, calendar reminders, apps, or just try to remember?
- Any tips for staying on top of all these moving parts?

**Solution Reveal Strategy**:
- Mentioned "working on my own system" vaguely
- Added edit line: "For those asking about my system, I can share more details in the comments"
- Shared link only when people asked in comments

### Lessons Learned

#### ❌ What Doesn't Work on Reddit
1. **Direct links in posts** (especially new accounts)
2. **Promotional language** ("built a tool", "check out my app")
3. **Leading with solution** instead of problem
4. **r/churning** - too strict on self-promotion
5. **Established accounts** with promotional history

#### ✅ What Works on Reddit
1. **New accounts** for clean slate
2. **Problem-focused posts** that resonate
3. **Community discussion** before promotion
4. **Organic link requests** in comments
5. **r/CreditCards** - more tool-friendly community
6. **Authentic vulnerability** (admitting mistakes)

### Reddit Filter Avoidance Strategy

#### Common Spam Triggers to Avoid
- Direct links in post body
- Keywords: "built", "created", "tool", "app" + link
- New domain + new account + link
- Multiple promotional posts
- Cross-posting identical content

#### Filter-Safe Techniques
- Focus on problem discussion first
- Use "working on a system" instead of "built a tool"
- Let community ask for solution
- Share links only in comments when requested
- Build conversation before revealing solution
