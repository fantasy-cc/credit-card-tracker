## üîÑ Updating Card Information (Community Contributions Welcome!)

Credit card benefits and annual fees change frequently. Help keep our data current!

### Quick Guide for Card Information Updates:

1. **Find outdated information**: Compare our data with official sources
2. **Verify with reliable sources**: Use [US Credit Card Guide](https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/) or official bank websites
3. **Update the seed file**: Edit `prisma/seed.ts` with new information
4. **Submit a pull request**: We'll review and merge quickly

**What to Update:**
- Annual fees that have changed
- Benefits that have been added, removed, or modified
- New credit cards from major issuers
- Corrections to benefit amounts or frequencies

**Quick Example:**
```typescript
// In prisma/seed.ts, find the card and update:
{
  name: 'Chase Sapphire Preferred',
  issuer: 'Chase',
  annualFee: 95, // ‚Üê Update this if changed
  benefits: [
    {
      description: '$50 Annual Hotel Credit', // ‚Üê Update amounts/descriptions
      maxAmount: 50, // ‚Üê Update this value
      // ... rest of benefit
    }
  ]
}
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fantasy-cc/credit-card-tracker.git
    cd credit-card-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**
    ```bash
    # Create your env file from the template and fill in values
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then edit .env with your secrets
    ```

4.  **Set up the database**
    ```bash
    # Generate Prisma client
    npx prisma generate

    # Run migrations
    npx prisma migrate dev

    # Seed the database with predefined cards
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

5.  **Start development server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Open your browser**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Required Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your database connection string (production or local)
- `DATABASE_URL_DEV` - Development database branch/instance for safe local work
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your app URL (http://localhost:3000 for development)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random secret for NextAuth.js
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
- `CRON_SECRET` - Secret for securing cron job endpoints
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for email notifications
- `SERPAPI_API_KEY` - API key used by card image download script

See `.env.example` for a complete template.

### Cron Jobs: Configure & Test

The project runs two daily cron jobs (configured in `vercel.json`). Both require an Authorization header with your `CRON_SECRET`.

- Endpoint: `/api/cron/check-benefits`
- Endpoint: `/api/cron/send-notifications`

Example manual trigger (local or remote):

```bash
# Replace <url> with http://localhost:3000 or your deployed URL
curl -i -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  <url>/api/cron/check-benefits

# Notifications cron supports an optional mockDate (non-production only)
curl -i -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "<url>/api/cron/send-notifications?mockDate=2025-08-15"
```

For safety guidance around cron and database operations, see `docs/safe-migration-guide.md` and `CURSOR.md` ‚Üí Deployment & Operations.

#### Vercel Cron configuration

The repository includes `vercel.json` with daily schedules. Example:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/check-benefits", "schedule": "0 5 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/send-notifications", "schedule": "15 5 * * *" }
  ]
}
```

### Database Recovery with Neon CLI

Since this project uses **Neon Database**, you have powerful recovery and investigation capabilities through the Neon CLI. This is essential for data loss incidents or database investigations.

#### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install Neon CLI globally
npm install -g neonctl

# Authenticate with your Neon account
neonctl auth
# Follow the prompts to log in via browser
```

#### Key Commands for Database Recovery

**List Projects and Branches:**
```bash
# List all your projects
neonctl projects list

# List branches in a specific project
neonctl branches list --project-id your-project-id
```

**Point-in-Time Recovery:**
```bash
# Create a recovery branch from a specific timestamp
neonctl branches create \
  --project-id your-project-id \
  --name recovery-branch-name \
  --parent production \
  --timestamp "2025-07-19T20:30:00Z"

# The connection string will be provided in the output
```

**Investigation Workflow:**
1. **Identify the incident time** (when data loss occurred)
2. **Create branches** at different timestamps around the incident
3. **Compare data** across branches using the provided connection strings
4. **Test with your application** by temporarily switching DATABASE_URL
5. **Recover data** by restoring from the working branch

#### Example Recovery Investigation

```bash
# Create branches for investigation
neonctl branches create --project-id abc123 --name before-incident --parent production --timestamp "2025-07-19T19:00:00Z"
neonctl branches create --project-id abc123 --name during-incident --parent production --timestamp "2025-07-19T20:30:00Z"
neonctl branches create --project-id abc123 --name after-incident --parent production --timestamp "2025-07-19T21:00:00Z"

# Each branch gives you a unique connection string to test against
# Use these in temporary scripts or update your .env temporarily
```

#### Best Practices for Data Recovery

- **Act quickly**: Neon's PITR typically covers 7-30 days
- **Create branches liberally**: They're free and instant due to copy-on-write
- **Test thoroughly**: Always verify data integrity before final recovery
- **Document timestamps**: Keep detailed records of when incidents occurred
- **Use SQL queries**: Test specific user data with direct database queries
- **Clean up**: Delete investigation branches after recovery to stay organized

#### Emergency Recovery Steps

1. **Stop the application** to prevent further data corruption
2. **Identify the last known good timestamp**
3. **Create a recovery branch** from that timestamp
4. **Verify data integrity** in the recovery branch
5. **Switch production** to point to the recovery branch
6. **Update your main branch** with the recovered data
7. **Resume application** with verified data

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always test recovery branches thoroughly before switching production traffic.
