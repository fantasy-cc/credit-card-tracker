## üè† Self-Hosting

Want complete control over your data? Self-hosting CouponCycle is straightforward and gives you full ownership of your credit card tracking.

### üéØ Why Self-Host?
- **Complete Data Privacy** - Your financial data never leaves your server
- **Custom Modifications** - Tailor the app to your specific needs
- **No Third-Party Dependencies** - Full control over uptime and performance
- **Educational Value** - Learn about web app deployment and management

### üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- **Server/VPS** with Node.js 18+ support
- **PostgreSQL Database** (local or cloud)
- **Domain Name** (optional but recommended)
- **Email Service** (Resend, SendGrid, or similar)
- **Google OAuth App** (for authentication)

### üöÄ Deployment with Vercel

The easiest way to self-host CouponCycle is with Vercel, which provides automatic deployments and built-in cron job support.

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Create required accounts**:
   - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting
   - [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for PostgreSQL database
   - [Resend](https://resend.com/) for email notifications
   - [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for OAuth

3. **Set up PostgreSQL database**:
   - Create a Neon database and get your connection string
   - It will look like: `postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx.neon.tech/dbname`

4. **Configure Google OAuth**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create new project ‚Üí Enable Google+ API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Add your Vercel domain to authorized origins

5. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub fork to Vercel
   - Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (see configuration below)
   - Deploy! Vercel will automatically run database migrations

6. **Your app will be live** at `https://your-app.vercel.app`

> **Alternative Platforms:** CouponCycle can also be deployed on Railway, DigitalOcean, Render, Fly.io, or using Docker. The Vercel approach is recommended for its simplicity and automatic cron job support.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key" # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-oauth-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-oauth-secret"

# Email Notifications
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxx" # From resend.com

# Security
CRON_SECRET="another-random-secret" # For cron job authentication
```

**Optional but Recommended:**
```bash
# Card image downloads (if you plan to add new cards)
SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key"

# Development branch (for safe testing)
DATABASE_URL_DEV="postgresql://dev-connection-string"
```

### üîí Security Best Practices

**Vercel handles most security automatically**, but follow these best practices:

1. **Environment Variables** - Never commit secrets to your repository
2. **Strong Secrets** - Generate secure values for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `CRON_SECRET`:
```bash
   # Generate secure secrets
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
3. **Database Security** - Use strong passwords and enable SSL (Neon enables this by default)
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep dependencies updated:
```bash
   npm audit && npm audit fix
   ```
5. **Custom Domain** - Use your own domain with HTTPS (Vercel provides SSL automatically)

### ‚è∞ Cron Jobs Setup

CouponCycle requires two daily cron jobs for proper functionality. **Vercel automatically handles these** based on the `vercel.json` configuration in the repository:

- `/api/cron/check-benefits` - Daily at 5:00 AM UTC
- `/api/cron/send-notifications` - Daily at 5:15 AM UTC

**No additional setup required** for Vercel deployments! The cron jobs will run automatically once deployed.

**Manual Testing:**
```bash
# Test the cron endpoints manually (useful for debugging)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/check-benefits
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/send-notifications
```

### üßπ Maintenance

**Regular Tasks:**
- **Monitor Vercel dashboard** for deployment status and function logs
- **Update dependencies** monthly: `npm audit && npm update` in your fork
- **Check Neon database** dashboard for usage and performance
- **Monitor email delivery** through Resend dashboard
- **Review GitHub Dependabot** alerts for security updates

**Health Checks:**
```bash
# Test cron endpoints manually (replace with your domain)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/check-benefits
```

### üÜò Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Check your `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
   - Verify Neon database is active and accessible

2. **OAuth Errors**
   - Verify redirect URIs in Google Console match your Vercel domain
   - Check that `NEXTAUTH_URL` points to your Vercel app URL

3. **Email Not Sending**
   - Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid in Vercel environment variables
   - Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

4. **Cron Jobs Not Running**
   - Check Vercel Functions tab for cron job execution logs
   - Verify `CRON_SECRET` is set correctly

### üí° Pro Tips

- **Fork first** - Always work from your own fork for easy updates
- **Use Vercel preview deployments** - Test changes before merging to main
- **Monitor Vercel analytics** - Built-in performance monitoring
- **Set up Vercel notifications** - Get alerts for deployment failures
- **Use custom domain** - Better for production use than `.vercel.app` subdomain

**Need Help?** Check Vercel's function logs first, then open an issue on GitHub with details about any errors you're encountering.
