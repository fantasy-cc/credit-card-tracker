Credit card benefits and annual fees change frequently. Help keep our data current!

### Quick Guide for Card Information Updates:

1. **Find outdated information**: Compare our data with official sources
2. **Verify with reliable sources**: Use [US Credit Card Guide](https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/) or official bank websites

**What to Update:**

**Quick Example:**
```typescript
// In prisma/seed.ts, find the card and update:
