## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema & Core Models

### User Management
- **User**: Authentication, notification preferences, and settings
- **Account/Session**: NextAuth.js models for OAuth

### Card & Benefit System
- **CreditCard**: User's cards with opening dates and card details
- **Benefit**: Individual benefits tied to cards (recurring cycles)
- **BenefitStatus**: Tracks completion status for each benefit cycle
- **PredefinedCard**: Template cards with issuer info and annual fees
- **PredefinedBenefit**: Template benefits linked to predefined cards

### Loyalty Program System
- **LoyaltyProgram**: Airline/hotel programs with expiration rules
- **LoyaltyAccount**: User's individual loyalty accounts with activity tracking

### Key Enums
- **BenefitFrequency**: `MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `YEARLY`, `ONE_TIME`
- **BenefitCycleAlignment**: `CARD_ANNIVERSARY`, `CALENDAR_FIXED`
- **LoyaltyProgramType**: `AIRLINE`, `HOTEL`, `RENTAL_CAR`, `CREDIT_CARD`

---

## üîÑ Core Business Logic

### Benefit Cycle Calculation System

The heart of the application is the `calculateBenefitCycle()` function in `src/lib/benefit-cycle.ts`:

**Purpose:** Determines the current active cycle dates for any benefit based on:
- Frequency (monthly/quarterly/yearly)
- Card opening date (for anniversary-based cycles)
- Calendar alignment (fixed dates like Jan-Mar for Q1)
- Reference date (typically "now")

**Two Alignment Types:**
1. **CARD_ANNIVERSARY**: Cycles based on when the card was opened
2. **CALENDAR_FIXED**: Cycles based on fixed calendar dates

**Examples:**
- Monthly Uber credit: Resets 1st of each month
- Quarterly travel credit: Resets every 3 months from card anniversary
- Semi-annual hotel credit: Resets every 6 months on calendar dates (Jan-Jun, Jul-Dec)

### Automated Benefit Status Management

**Daily Cron Job** (`/api/cron/check-benefits`):
- Runs daily via Vercel cron
- Updates `BenefitStatus` records for all users
- Creates new cycles, maintains current cycles
- Secured with `CRON_SECRET` header

**Process:**
1. Fetch all user cards with benefits
2. Calculate current cycle dates for each benefit
3. Upsert `BenefitStatus` records (create if new, update if changed)
4. Maintain completion status across cycles

---

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Environment Setup

**Local Development:**
- The project includes a fully configured `.env` file for local development
- All required environment variables are already set up
- No additional configuration needed for local development

**Required Environment Variables for Production:**
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." # Production
DATABASE_URL_DEV="postgresql://..." # Development branch

# Authentication  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # or production URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"

# Services
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"
CRON_SECRET="your-cron-secret"
SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key" # For card image downloads
```

> **Note for Cursor:** The `.env` file already exists in this repository and is fully configured. The Cursor agent cannot access it directly due to environment isolation, but local commands and the app will still read from `.env`. Refer to `.env.example` if you need a reference of keys.

### Database Safety Rules ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL - NEVER RUN:**
- `npx prisma migrate reset` (wipes ALL data)
- `npx prisma db push --force-reset`
- Any command with `--force-reset` on production

**Safe Development Workflow:**
1. Always use development database branch first
2. Test schema changes on dev branch: `export DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL_DEV`
3. Use `npx prisma migrate dev` for schema changes
4. Let Vercel handle production deployments automatically

**Explicit user-approved production changes:**
- If and only if the human user explicitly requests it, it is acceptable to run non-destructive operations against the production database after verifying `DATABASE_URL` points to production.
- Allowed non-destructive ops include:
  - Seeding/upserting predefined catalog data: `npx prisma db seed`
  - Applying already-generated migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Still forbidden on production: destructive resets (`migrate reset`, `db push --force-reset`, manual `DROP` statements), or anything that erases/modifies user data outside of intended migrations.
- Always:
  - Echo/print `DATABASE_URL` (mask credentials) and confirm the target.
  - Prefer read-only or upsert-style scripts for catalog updates.
  - Document the action in commit messages or ops notes.

**Database Environment Priority**: Shell variables override `.env` file. Use `unset DATABASE_URL` to clear overrides and use `.env` configuration. Always verify target with `node scripts/check-database-connection.js`.

### Adding New Credit Cards

1. **Research Card**: Verify benefits at [US Credit Card Guide](https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/)
2. **Download Image**: `node scripts/download-card-image.js --name "Card Name"`
3. **Update Seed**: Add card and benefits to `prisma/seed.ts`
4. **Re-seed**: `npx prisma db seed`

### Updating Existing Card Benefits

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Updating existing card benefits requires a **two-step process**:

1. **Update Templates** (affects new users): Edit `prisma/seed.ts` ‚Üí `npx prisma db seed`
2. **Migrate Existing Users**: Run appropriate migration script with `--force`

**See `docs/predefined-card-update-guide.md` for complete workflow.**

**Common Issue**: If you only update templates, existing users will still see old benefits until migrated.

**Benefit Inclusion Criteria:**
- Must have cyclical value (credits, points, free nights)
- Must reset on trackable cycles (monthly/quarterly/yearly)
- Exclude always-on perks (multipliers, insurance, status, memberships)
- Verify with reliable sources

**Specific Exclusions:**
- Priority Pass memberships (always-on access, no cyclical reset)
- Lounge memberships (Admirals Club, Centurion Lounge access)
- Insurance benefits (travel insurance, purchase protection)
- Earning rate multipliers (3x points on dining, etc.)
- Elite status benefits (hotel/airline status)
- One-time signup bonuses

### Testing

**Available Tests:**
```bash
npm test                                    # Run all tests
node scripts/test-drag-drop.cjs            # Test reordering functionality
node scripts/test-annual-fee-roi.cjs       # Test ROI calculations
node scripts/check-database-connection.js  # Verify database connection
```

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

### Vercel Configuration

**Automatic GitHub Deployment:**
- **Push to main branch** ‚Üí Automatic production deployment
- **No manual deployment needed** - Vercel handles everything
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- Build command: `prisma generate && next build`
- Database migrations run automatically via `npx prisma migrate deploy`

**Cron Jobs** (configured in `vercel.json`):
- Daily benefit status updates: `/api/cron/check-benefits`
- Daily email notifications: `/api/cron/send-notifications`
- Both require the header `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`

Manual trigger examples:

```bash
# Replace <url> with http://localhost:3000 or the deployed URL
curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" <url>/api/cron/check-benefits

# Notifications cron supports an optional mockDate (non-production only)
curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" "<url>/api/cron/send-notifications?mockDate=2025-08-15"
```

### Database Management

**Production Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with branching
- Main branch: Production data
- Development branch: Safe testing environment
- Point-in-time recovery available for data incidents

**Migration Process:**
1. Test on development branch (optional)
2. Commit migration files to main branch
3. Push to GitHub ‚Üí Vercel automatically runs `npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. No manual deployment steps required

**Production changes on request (non-destructive):**
- When the user asks to update production data (e.g., add or refresh predefined cards/benefits):
  1. Verify target: `node scripts/check-database-connection.js` (ensure it reports production/Neon main)
  2. Run non-destructive seed: `DATABASE_URL="<prod>" npx prisma db seed`
  3. For schema already migrated in code, apply to prod: `DATABASE_URL="<prod>" npx prisma migrate deploy`
  4. Never use reset/force-reset commands on production

### Monitoring & Analytics

- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Console logging with structured error handling
- **User Activity**: Email notification delivery tracking
- **Cron Observability**: Cron routes log attempt time, authorization presence (never log the secret), counts of processed records, and success/failure totals

### Runbooks

- Cron failures: Re-run manually using the commands above; inspect logs for upserts attempted/succeeded/failed; verify `CRON_SECRET` configured in env and Vercel
- Database incident recovery: Follow the Neon CLI workflow in README (‚ÄúDatabase Recovery with Neon CLI‚Äù) to branch by timestamp, verify, and switch
- Notification testing: Use `send-notifications?mockDate=YYYY-MM-DD` locally with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (mockDate ignored in production)
