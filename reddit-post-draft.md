Hey r/CreditCards!

I kept missing credit card annual benefits and it was costing me money (lost $300+ this year alone), so I built a simple tracker for my personal use to keep track of:

- Annual credits and their cycle dates
- Quarterly category bonuses  
- ROI vs annual fees
- Benefit deadlines and reminders

Figured I'd share it since some of you might find it useful too: **https://coupon-cycle.site**

It's still under active development, so if you check it out and have any recommendations or feature requests, I'd love to hear them!

How do you all currently track your benefits? Always curious to learn what works for others.

## **Follow-up Strategy**:

- Respond genuinely to all comments
